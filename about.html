		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
			<p> If you didn't think I was busy enough with a full load of courses and 2 jobs, also manage to squeeze in
				a few hobbies to boot.
			</p>
		<h3> Running </h3>
			<p> While most people may thnk running double digit miles as a new form of torture, I do it at least once a week.
			I've managed to find an almost meditative joy from running long distances and am currently training for my second
			half-marathon. My goal for this May is to complete the race in under 2 hours and 15 minutes.
			</p>
		<h3> Travel </h3>
			<p>
				My family has been moving and driving long distances since I was very young. Driving around and seeing new places
				has inspired my love of travelling to new places. I've been lucky enough to visit London, Sweden, and Japan with Dublin
				being next on my list. My favorite thing to do is to take a weekend afternoon and explore areas of a city (new or old) to find
				what I haven't found before. My next trip is to Dublin, Ireland for the St. Patrick's Day celebration.
