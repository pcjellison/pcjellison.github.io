		<h1>Senior Project - Mobile Budgeting App </h1>

	<div class="projSection">
		<h2> February 4, 2019 </h2>
		<p> As my senior year comes to a close I will be making use of all the skills I have developed over the past 4 years to create a senior project.
			Many students find themselves struggling to create and maintain a budget, and these issues can be compounded with the increasing debt we find outselves in.
		</p>
		<p> I've decided to help make this necessary skill easier for students and non-students alike by creating an easy-to-use budgeting app that will help students
			get their finances in check. You will be able to find updates and links to my project as the semester goes on.
